# Node.js Professional README Generator

This was my first time working with Node.js. I've created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The command-line prompts user's inforomation about their application repository. The prompts include information about the title of users' project, & sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When users' choose a license for their application from the list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README. Users' github username, email address, and LinkedIn are all added for any futhur questions by readers. 


## Installation
 To utilize the README generator within your command line, users' would need to install node.js and npm inquirer package. 

This application was invoked by using the following command. 
 ```bash
node index.js
```
